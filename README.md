# Horiseon-Marketing

## Description

This is a project for Horiseon-Marketing to structure the code to fit the accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

This project was to help me enchance my coding skills by learning how to "debug" a project and make it better by restructuring code without changing what the project does.

I was able to learn alot more about semantic elements, how to properly structure and how to comment on CSS pages.

## Installation

In order to make the site more accessible i haad to make the following changes to the project:

First i was able to change the title of the project in the HTML to show Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc. 

Next i changed the div elements to semantic elements such as aside, nav, header, section. From then i renamed the CSS style sheet to reflect the semantic element changes in HTML. 

One element that wasn't working was the #search-engine-optimization on the site. When you would click the link in the nav section it wouldn't automatically scroll down to the seo section. I changed this by changing the code to an id rather than a class. 

Next i went ahead and added a "alt" element to the img section. This allows for a description to the image provided on the site. 

Last thing i did was add comments to the CSS section and the project was complete.

## Usage

When you open the project the following should appear. One of the major changes to the actual functionality of the site is the nav bar. As you can see on the top right hand side.

If you click Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Mangement, or Social Media Marketing it should bring you to the heading of which ever nav button you selected.
